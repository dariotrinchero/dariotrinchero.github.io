undergraduate mathematics modules at Stellenbosch University.

## My philosophy on tutoring

For all of my tutoring career (bar a short stint in 2017), I have been employed by my
university. On moral grounds, I prefer not to offer private tutoring, even though it pays better.
This is because South Africa is a country haunted by past injustice that has led to gross
financial inequality; the people who most need help thus often cannot afford it privately.
By tutoring through the university, I ensure that my assistance reaches a wider audience
with no additional expenses to the students.

## Modules taught

Below is a breakdown of my tutoring experience. My official job title has changed on
occasion in accordance with Stellenbosch University's naming conventions for certain
collections of duties. To avoid ambiguity, I have simply listed the duties I managed for
each module.

| Module          | Level       | Module contents             | Years tutored | Description of duties                                                |

### Explanation of module levels

There is a small discrepancy between how college year groups are named in the US and in
South Africa. The 'Module level' column of the above table follows the South African
convention. Here is a handy translation table:

| US year group name | South African year group name |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Freshman           | First year                    |
| Sophomore          | Second year                   |
| Junior             | Third year                    |
| Senior             | Honours                       |

## Online tutoring

My style of online tutoring mainly involves going through problems live, writing notes via
a Wacom tablet. [Here are](/files/tut8.pdf) some [typical examples](/files/tut4.pdf) of the
[resulting notes](/files/tut5.pdf). While it began because of Covid-19, I embrace the online
format - my tutorials were recorded, and supplemented with live online quizzes, feedback forms,
and occasionally even [live code examples](/files/tut7_notebook.ipynb). Students consistently
valued being able to revisit notes and/or recordings of sessions.
