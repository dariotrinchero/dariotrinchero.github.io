In the first half of 2024, I lectured first year mathematics at Stellenbosch University,
covering mainly precalculus and calculus. I taught a class of approximately 220 students.

## My duties

- Teaching classes (5h of lectures each week)
- Compiling tutorials & memoranda
- Compiling & marking exams
- Corresponding & meeting with students as needed

## My feedback

I set up an anonymous feedback system for my classes whereby students could review my
lectures and submit comments. My feedback was generally positive, with the main criticisms
usually pertaining to the pace of the module, my vocabulary being inaccessible, or my
tendency to speak too quickly at times.

Several students expressed appreciation of my enthusiasm toward the subject. Some comments
along these lines are given below (selected with some obvious bias):

> Love the Lectures, I never liked math in High school but your enthusiasm and knowledge
> make this module enjoyable.

> I appreciate your style of lecturing. Your focus on developing a deeper understanding
> of the concepts reflects what I believe to be the benefit of an academic university environment.

> Overall your class is interesting and you make maths (that is a headache for some) to be fun!
> Your intelligence is inspiring and your excitement about the subject is refreshing.

> I really enjoy your enthusiasm for math, it is highly contagious. Thank you for your positivity. 

> My mathematics lecture is what I look forward to quite often in the week.
> It is a conducive and learning friendly environment.
> My lecturerâ€™s passion is what inspires me to be as passionate about mathematics.

## My lecturing style

My lectures tend to be highly structured, with sections, theorems, comments, etc all numbered
and cross-referenced.

My pedagogy is generally to begin by formulating definitions / theorems in their full abstract
generality *before* launching into concrete examples. I appreciate that there is some contention
about whether this is the most effective pedagogy, so I wish to briefly motivate this decision.

The alternative approach is to structure lessons in such a way that students build towards
abstract ideas by generalizing / extending known concrete examples. The thinking is that this
makes the abstract notions, when first encountered, feel more natural and familiar, and that it
more closely mirrors the process of doing mathematical research. Generally, I agree with these
advantages. However, I feel that this approach has some major downsides, when applied to a large
introductory course:

1. **It buries the lead.** Leaving important abstract results for late in the course gives students
too little time to digest / memorize / play with / apply them. On the other hand, leading with the
result allows time to process it, and it contextualizes the examples that follow. In short, a difficult
concept encountered early is far more likely to stick.
1. **It alienates weaker students.** Students enter a freshman course with a wide range of mathematical
exposure and ability. Few students are yet mathematically mature enough to identify and abstract
patterns  in some given set of concrete examples. As such, the feeling of self-discovery that
comes from a concrete-to-abstract pedagogy is lost on many.
1. **It takes too long.** A freshman course has a lot of ground to cover, spanning many topics.
For an abstract idea to feel well-motivated, one needs to first see a lot of examples. There
simply isn't time to do this effectively during the lectures. Instead, lecture time is more
economically spent in parsing the abstract notion and showing a few examples, with the
remainder of examples being relegated to tutorials / exercises.

That being said, I am not dogmatic about this approach. I have limited teaching experience, and
I am certainly open to the idea that alternative pedagogies can be more effective in some / all
cases.
