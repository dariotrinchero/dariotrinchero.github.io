In the first half of 2024, I lectured first year mathematics at Stellenbosch University,
covering mainly precalculus and calculus. I taught a class of approximately 220 students.

## My duties

- Teaching classes (5h of lectures each week)
- Compiling tutorials & memoranda
- Contributing assessment questions
- Corresponding & meeting with students as needed

## My feedback

I set up an anonymous feedback system for my classes whereby students could review my
lectures and submit comments. My feedback was generally positive, with the main criticisms
being related to the pace of the module, as well as my tendency to speak a bit too quickly
when excited.

Several students expressed appreciation of my enthusiasm toward the subject. Some comments
along these lines are given below (chosen with obvious bias for positive comments):

> Love the Lectures, I never liked math in High school but your enthusiasm and knowledge
> make this module enjoyable.

> I appreciate your style of lecturing. Your focus on developing a deeper understanding
> of the concepts reflects what I believe to be the benefit of an academic university environment.

> Overall your class is interesting and you make maths (that is a headache for some) to be fun!
> Your intelligence is inspiring and your excitement about the subject is refreshing.
