## Overview

This is a LaTeX template for a **research project journal**. I designed it for my PhD
thesis, but it could probably be used for more general project management. It is intended
as a place for recording daily *work*, tracking *progress*, outstanding *tasks*, lingering
*questions*, *answers* to those questions, and so on.

## More details

I wrote an accompanying [blog post](/posts/2023/10/journal/) about the creation of this
journal. You can find details, usage information, [screenshots](/posts/2023/10/journal#screenshots),
and so on over there.
