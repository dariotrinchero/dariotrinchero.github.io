## Overview

For a long time I have produced all of my slideshows using LaTeX with
[Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer). This works great because Beamer ships with a whole
lot of great features that are hard to find in other slideshow software like Powerpoint,
including:

- good math typesetting,
- bibliography management & automatic citations, and
- separation between content/structure and styling (for the most part).

The main issue with Beamer is that it looks a little dated. Here's a title slide with **default
styling**:

<img src='/images/beamer_default.png' width="450" style='border: 1px solid #CCC'>

As such, one of the very first things I did when starting out in Beamer (back in 2018) was
to make [my own theme](https://github.com/dariotrinchero/beamer) from scratch, which I have
been using (and steadily updating) ever since.

## Main features

Aside from looking a bit cleaner and more modern, here are some bonus nice things [my
theme](https://github.com/dariotrinchero/beamer) does:

- define a color palette,
- define some custom commands for emphasizing & coloring text,
- automatically insert full-screen section title slides (with optional graphic), and
- render a segmented wheel to indicate progress through slides.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots showing off the basic theme and some of the features mentioned
above:
