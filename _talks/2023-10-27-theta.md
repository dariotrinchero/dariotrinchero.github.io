## Overview

This talk closely follows the material covered in [Theta Functions and
Knots](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) by RÄƒzvan Gelca. The main goal is to build up to the
punchline of chapter 5 from that book[^thm] - namely, the isomorphism between the space
$\Theta^\Pi_N(\Sigma_g)$ of *theta functions* defined by a Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$,
and the *skein space* $\mathcal{L}_N(H_g)$ of its enclosed handlebody $H_g$.

This is a remarkable result - reaching it takes us on a lightning tour through quantum
mechanics, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and representation theory.

## Why this matters

The isomorphism in question, aside from being interesting in its own right, is especially
relevant to my [current research](/#research) - indeed, my research aims to improve a
certain analogue of this very isomorphism.

To be precise, it turns out that the theory of theta functions as given in Gelca can be
formulated as a specific instance of Chern-Simons theory[^u1], namely 'abelian'
Chern-Simons theory, where the gauge group is $\mathrm{U}(1)$ instead of the usual
$\mathrm{SU}(2)$. My research topic deals with an isomorphism analogous to the one
described above, but arising within the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ version of the theory. We hope
to "improve" this isomorphism by stating it in a *basis-free* manner, which has currently
not been done. This is of interest because expanding with respect to the preferred basis
is generally hard.

## Related references

My [quantum group](/talks/2023-10-12-quantgrps) seminar series connects to the material
discussed here. Indeed, [Gelca](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) introduces quantum
groups[^gelca] *precisely* in order to frame the theory of theta functions
in terms of them. This description of theta functions is extremely efficient and elegant -
well worth checking out!

[^thm]: Specifically, this result appears in [Gelca](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) as
	Theorem 5.7 in section 5.4.2. We have used the same notation as Gelca in stating it.

[^u1]: [Gelca](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) describes how the construction above forms
	part of a TQFT in section 7.5, and discusses the connection with Chern-Simons theory
	in the epilogue (chapter 9).

[^gelca]: The quantum group discussion in [Gelca](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) (chapter 8)
	is very succinct, but good nevertheless - ultimately, Gelca made it into the reference
	list for my quantum groups talks also.
