## Overview

This talk closely follows the material covered in [*Theta Functions and
Knots*](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) by RÄƒzvan Gelca. The main goal is to build up to the
punchline of chapter 5 from that book[^thm] - namely, the isomorphism between the space
$\Theta^\Pi_N(\Sigma_g)$ of *theta functions* defined by a Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$,
and the *skein space* $\mathcal{L}_N(H_g)$ of its enclosed handlebody $H_g$.

## Why this matters

The isomorphism in question, aside from being remarkable in its own right, is especially
important to me and my [current research](/#research). Indeed, this isomorphism is (a
simpler case of) the very isomorphism that my research aims to improve!

To be precise, the case treated in Gelca arises in the simplest version of Chern-Simons
theory[^u1], namely 'abelian' Chern-Simons theory, where the gauge group is
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ instead of the usual $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. More importantly, the relevant
isomorphism is given in Gelca on the level of a basis. My primary research objective is
precisely to give a *basis-free* construction of this isomorphism (in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$
Chern-Simons theory), since expanding with respect to the preferred basis is generally
hard.

## Related references

My [quantum group](/talks/2023-10-12-quantgrps) seminar series connects to the material
discussed here. Indeed, [Gelca](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) introduces quantum
groups[^gelca] *precisely* in order to frame the theory of theta functions
in terms of them. This description of theta functions is extremely efficient and elegant -
well worth checking out!

[^thm]: Specifically, this result appears in [Gelca](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) as
	Theorem 5.7 in section 5.4.2. We have used the same notation as Gelca in stating it.

[^u1]: [Gelca](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) describes how the construction above forms
	part of a TQFT in section 7.5, and discusses the connection with Chern-Simons theory
	in the epilogue (chapter 9).

[^gelca]: The quantum group discussion in [Gelca](https://doi.org/10.1142/8872) (chapter 8)
	is very succinct, but good nevertheless - ultimately, Gelca made it into the reference
	list for my quantum groups talks also.
