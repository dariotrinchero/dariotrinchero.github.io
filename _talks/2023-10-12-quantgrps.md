**Recordings:** TODO

Brief introductory seminar series presented to my research group (led by [Bruce
Bartlett](https://math.sun.ac.za/bbartlett/)), with a few guests.

The goal is to introduce quantum groups assuming little background, showing a
few examples, but focussing mainly on the perspective that quantum groups give rise to
link invariants through their representation category.

The presentation is far from exhaustive - this topic is vast, and a thorough treatment
requires little short of an entire textbook. That said, my notes include references (in
pink) for each section, which should help an interested reader dive deeper. Notable
omissions are the Drinfeld quantum double, the construction of quantum sl(2), and the
proofs of several of the assertions made.

I have a lot more to say about this topic, but meeting time slots were limited towards the
end of the year. I may resume this talk series in future.
