Introductory talk organized by the Stellenbosch University Mathematics Society (SUMS) for
an undergraduate audience.

## Overview

In this talk, we take a tour through a number of increasingly abstract definitions for
tensors and the tensor product, starting at the component-wise definition in terms of
transformation properties which is common in physics literature, and working towards
category-theoretic definitions and the **tensor-hom adjunction**.

The goal of this talk is a *pedagogical* one: I wish to exhibit tensors in their full
*basis-free* and abstract generality, but also connect this to the concrete incarnation
used by physicists. This is motivated by my own past frustration at having had need for
tensors in physics well before encountering rigorous definitions.

## Notable inclusions & omissions

The time constraint and level of the audience force me to make some concessions; the most
egregious of which is that I do not actually define categories or adjunctions, but merely
borrow some terminology from category theory. I also begin by defining vector spaces,
since some first-years in attendance will not have seen the abstract definition.

Another notable omission is a discussion of tensor algebras, (anti)symmetrization, and
similar further topics in multilinear algebra.
