Introductory talk organized by the Stellenbosch University Mathematics Society (SUMS) for
an undergraduate audience.

The goal is to rigorously and pedagogically introduce the concept of *tensors*, via a number
of increasingly-abstract definitions for the tensor product space of two vector spaces.
This is motivated by my own experience at having been frustrated in undergraduate by
having need for tensors in physics well before encountering any rigorous definitions.

A notable omission is a discussion of tensor algebras, and such further topics in
multilinear algebra.
