Introductory talk organized by the Stellenbosch University Cosmic Conversations (CC)
society for an undergraduate audience.

This talk closely follows a paper by
[Kissinger and van de Wetering (2019)](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2019-04-26-134), but
expands a little on the presentation from a pedagogical point of view.
In a nutshell, the paper (and hence my talk) introduces the concepts of measurement-based
quantum computing (MBQC) and the ZX-calculus, applying the latter to prove the
completeness of the former.

My primary objective was to expose undergraduates to the power of the *graphical calculus*
approach to computations in (suitable) monoidal categories. Such graphical calculi
encompass an incredibly versatile collection of related methods, applied across a
[surprisingly wide range of fields](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.0340.pdf).
