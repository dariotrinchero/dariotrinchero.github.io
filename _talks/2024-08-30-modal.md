Colloquium presented at The Cave Wall, a student-run philosophy club at
Stellenbosch University, covering the *modal ontological argument*. Given the
diverse interdisciplinary audience, I do not assume familiarity with formal logic.

## Abstract

<span style='font-size: 12pt'>
In Prologion III, Anselm presents a famous ontological argument for the existence of God.
The argument assumes possibility of the existence of a being whose very existence is _necessary_,
and from this _possibility_ alone concludes the existence of such a being. On first reading, this
argument may appear abstract and unconvincing - in particular, one may doubt whether the
conclusion indeed follows from the premiss. Worse still, it is equally difficult to convincingly
rebut this argument without first making very precise several hidden assumptions about the
modalities of "necessity" and "possibility" upon which the argument depends.

In this talk, I introduce one framework in which such alethic modal reasoning may be
formalised, namely the *S5 modal logic*. I then formally prove Anselm's argument in S5, and
discuss the implications for the forcefulness of the argument. The main reference for this talk is
[Philosophical and Mathematical Logic](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-03255-5) by De Swart (2018).

## Mathematics $\cap$ philosophy $\cap$ computer science

While I do find Anselm's ontological argument interesting, my real motivation for this talk
was to spread awareness of the *many* beautiful philosophical applications of **modal logics**.

In the late 1950s, legendary philosopher Saul Kripke, together with (equally legendary) mathematician
Andr√© Joyal, discovered an elegant [formal semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_semantics)
for non-classical logics, finally allowing such logics to be studied model-theoretically[^model].

Modal logics are surprisingly versatile in their expressiveness, and so find applications in a wide
range of disciplines; thus, even if one cares little for philosophy, it may still be worth
learning a little about them. The most interesting modal logics (some of which are mentioned in
the slides) include the following (though the list is far from exhaustive):

| Logic                                                                          | Reasons about                  | Example field of application      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| [alethic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#Alethic_logic)       | necessity & possibility        | philosophy of religion (see talk) |
| [deontic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_logic)                   | moral obligation               | ethical philosophy                |
| [epistemic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_modal_logic)         | agents' knowledge              | distributed systems               |
| [doxastic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxastic_logic)                 | agents' beliefs                | game theory                       |
| [temporal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic)          | time evolution of propositions | model checking                    |
| [provability logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provability_logic)           | provability of statements      | mathematical logic                |
| [dynamic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_logic_(modal_logic))     | states & actions of programs   | formal verification               |
| [computation tree logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic) | branching time evolution       | model checking                    |

These logics each have different axioms, but all employ modal operators, and have semantics
given in terms of Kripke frames.
