Seminar as part of the online "Room 316" series hosted by Prof. A. P. Balachandran of
Syracuse University.

I discuss the results of my [Master's thesis](https://doi.org/10019.1/126944) - namely,
the results of a double-pinhole interference calculation in the 3D fuzzy-sphere formalism
of non-commutative quantum mechanics, as well as the implications for the measurement
problem and the infamous quantum-to-classical transition.

These results can also be found in the form of a
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aop.2023.169224), the preprint of which is on the
[arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.01449).

I presented a very similar talk, albeit slightly more preliminary, on 24 November 2022
at the Stellenbosch University Faculty of Science
[Postgraduate Research Conference](https://www.sun.ac.za/english/Lists/Events/DispForm.aspx?ID=5357).
