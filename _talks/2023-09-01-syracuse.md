Seminar as part of the online "Room 316" series hosted by Prof. A. P. Balachandran of
Syracuse University. The seminar broadly discusses the results of my
[Master's thesis](https://doi.org/10019.1/126944).

## Overview

The talk focusses on the structure of space at short length scales, and possible ways that
this can be tested.

We introduce the *fuzzy-sphere* formalism for quantum mechanics in 3D non-commutative
space, then discuss a two-pinhole interference setup in this formalism. We show that quantum
interference is suppressed for macroscopic objects, so that a quantum-to-classical transition
occurs, and we explain the mechanism behind this transition.

Finally, we make contact with existing and future experimental implementations, thereby
providing falsifiable predictions for the short length scale structure of space.

I presented a very similar talk, albeit slightly more preliminary, on 24 November 2022
