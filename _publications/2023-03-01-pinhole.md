## Overview

The paper focusses on the structure of space at short length scales, and possible ways that
this can be tested.

We adopt the well-established *fuzzy-sphere* formalism for quantum mechanics in non-commutative
space, and calculate the quantum interference for in a simple two-pinhole setup. We show that
interference is suppressed for macroscopic objects, so that a quantum-to-classical transition
occurs. The mechanism behind this transition is decoherence, only without requiring an external
heat bath.

We make contact with existing and future experimental implementations, providing falsifiable
predictions for the short length scale structure of space.
