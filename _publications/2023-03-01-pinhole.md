This paper discusses the results of my [Master's thesis](https://doi.org/10019.1/126944) -
namely, the results of a double-pinhole interference calculation in the 3D fuzzy-sphere
formalism of non-commutative quantum mechanics, as well as the implications for the
measurement problem and the infamous quantum-to-classical transition. This thesis was
supervised by [Prof. Frederik Scholtz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f5bmW68AAAAJ&hl=en),
my coauthor on the paper.

The results discussed in this paper were also presented in a
[webinar](/talks/2023-09-01-syracuse) as part of the "Room 316" series hosted by Prof. A. P.
Balachandran of Syracuse University.
