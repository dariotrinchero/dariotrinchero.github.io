Hi, I'm Dario. I'm a student of mathematical physics, working on my PhD at [Stellenbosch
University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english) under the guidance of
[Bruce Bartlett](https://math.sun.ac.za/bbartlett/).
My research focusses on topological quantum field theory (TQFT).

## My current research {#research}

In Chern-Simons theory, as in any TQFT, one must associate to each surface a corresponding
vector space[^tqft]. Historically, there have been two rather distinct approaches to
formulating this vector space in Chern-Simons theory.

On the one hand, this space can be constructed by the usual machinery of *geometric
quantization* - as a space of *holomorphic sections* of a certain line bundle living over
the moduli space of flat $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ connections on the surface[^andersen2019].
On the other hand, the space can be considered a space of *skeins* - linear combinations
of diagrams drawn inside the 3-dimensional handlebody bounded by our surface, modulo
certain local 'skein relations' that hold inside each embedded ball[^blanchet1995].

My current PhD work is focussed on writing down a new basis-free isomorphism between the
holomorphic section and skein spaces, essentially providing another (simpler) answer to
[this MathOverflow question](https://mathoverflow.net/q/86792). The idea for this
isomorphism comes from my supervisor, but several steps are still imprecise or require
further proof or verification.

## My background

I have a mixed background in pure mathematics and physics. I completed a bachelors in
physics, Honours in mathematics[^hons], Master's in physics, and am working on my PhD
in mathematics.

My [Master's thesis](/files/msc_thesis.pdf) investigated a natural
quantum-to-classical transition arising (by the mechanism of decoherence) in the 3D
fuzzy-sphere model of quantum mechanics on a spacetime with non-commutative geometry.
I published [this paper](/publications/2023-03-01-pinhole) about my results. During my
Master's years, I also took courses on general relativity, quantum computing, and
solid-state physics.

My [Honours mini-thesis](https://zenodo.org/record/8414171) was an expository account
following a paper by [Chelkak, Cimasoni, & Kassel (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08242)
that derives a certain formula for the Ising model embedded on a surface. During my
Honours year I also took courses on QFT, Lie theory, functional analysis, measure
theory, statistical physics, and C\*-algebras.

{:.notice--warning}

I am generally interested in most topics in mathematical physics, low-dimensional
topology, and differential geometry, especially non-commutative geometry,
topological quantum field theory, and applications of graphical calculi. I want to
learn more about higher categories, homological algebra, and Morse-Cerf theory.

I am open (and eager) to collaborate on these and other topics. Please feel free to
[reach out!](/contact/)

	[Atiyah (1990)](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511623868) - that is, a certain functor
	from the cobordism category to the category of vector spaces.

	(the 'senior' year, in US terminology) into an optional 'Honours' degree.
