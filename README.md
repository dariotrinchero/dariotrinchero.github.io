# Personal Homepage

Source code for my personal website, hosting my CV, publications, slides for various talks
I have given, and blog posts.

Design template forked from [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io); see LICENSE.md.

## Building locally

The below instructions are taken from the [Academic
Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) GitHub repo:

1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed: `sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs`
1. Run `bundle clean` to clean up the directory (no need to run `--force`)
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll liveserve` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.
